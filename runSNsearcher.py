    '''
    This function runs the SNsearch function on all of the .fits files in a specified directory,
    making sure that the outputs for each file are kept separate from each other.

    -----

    Parameters:

    dirfilepath (string): the directory containing the files you want the program to run on, which
    the program will also save all the output files to.

    pos_SN_thresh (integer): the threshold above which positive S/N is considered significant
    (should be positive)

    neg_SN_thresh (integer): the threshold below which negative S/N is considered significant
    (should be negative)

    pos_count_thresh (integer): the amount of consecutive positive S/N hits that is considered
    significant

    neg_count_thresh (integer): the amount of consecutive negative S/N hits that is considered
    significant

    dyslit (integer): how many pixels above and below the center of the slit you want the slit 
    to extend (for example, for a 10 pixel wide slit, you should set dyslit = 5)

    negSN (Boolean): determines if the program looks for negative S/N (True = yes, False = no)

    continuum (Boolean): determines if the program looks for continuum emission (True = yes, 
    False = no). Only matters if negSN == True

    Outputs:

    None
